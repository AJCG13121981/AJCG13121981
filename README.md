## 1) Streamlit compatibility fix
Repository: cognitive-suite  
PR: https://github.com/atlantyde-labs/cognitive-suite/pull/53

**Problem**  
Streamlit deprecated `st.experimental_rerun`, causing compatibility issues.

**Solution**  
Migrated to `st.rerun` and updated related code paths to keep the app working on newer Streamlit versions.

**How to verify**
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run the Streamlit app.
3. Confirm rerun behavior works without errors.

**Evidence**
